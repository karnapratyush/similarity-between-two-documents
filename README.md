# similarity-between-two-documents
the following code measures the similarity between any two documents presented as strings


while I was studying MIT data structures and algorithms, lecture two they described how to measure similarity between two sentence but didnot mention the code. Here I am writing the code for the same.

Here we are decribing each word as a vector. Thus there are  some unique words including document 1 and 2. Both document is a linear combination of two. We can express the closeness between the two documents by finding their theta. more the theta less the similarity between two words and vice-versa. 


thus we can find the similarity between two documents.

Suggestions will be appreciated
